In implementing the models mentioned in the tentative report, Github Copilot is used to generate boilerplate code and assist with repetitive coding tasks.
The AI tool helps streamline the development process by suggesting code snippets, functions, and classes based on the context provided in the codebase.
However, all final implementations, logic, and architecture decisions are made by Zi Xuan Szeto to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to project requirements.
The use of Github Copilot is intended to enhance productivity while maintaining full control over the code quality and integrity.

To be clear, core algorithms in `/src` is handwritten, and the `/scripts` folders contain mostly utility scripts that are less critical to the main implementation.
