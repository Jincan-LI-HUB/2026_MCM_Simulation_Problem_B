4.1 Model 1: Short -Term Passenger Flow Prediction (Task 1)  
4.1.1 Purpose of the Model  
In order to  support proactive elevator dispatching and parking decisions, it is necessary 
to anticipate near -future passenger demand.  
Based on the exploratory data analysis presented in Section 3, elevator hall -call arrivals 
show two key characteristics:  
1. Strong regularity within a day , with recurring peaks during lunchtime and 
evening hours.  
2. Short-term dependence , where demand in the next few minutes is closely 
related to recent demand levels.  
Motivated by these observations, we develop a mathematical model to predict the total 
number of hall calls in the next 5 -minute time interval . The model is designed to be 
simple, interpretable, and suitable for real -time implementation in an elevator group 
control system.  
4.1.2 Notation and Time Discretization  
Time is divided into consecutive 5 -minute intervals. Let  
𝑦𝑡=number of hall calls occurring during the 𝑡-th 5-minute interval . 
 
The objective of Task 1 is to estimate the expected demand in the next interval:  
𝑦̂𝑡+1=𝔼[𝑦𝑡+1∣ℱ𝑡], 
 
where ℱ𝑡represents all information available up to time 𝑡. 
To account for the significant behavioral differences observed between weekdays and 
weekends, we introduce a regime indicator:  
𝑤𝑡={1,if interval 𝑡 occurs on a weekday ,
0,if interval 𝑡 occurs on a weekend . 
4.1.3 Time -of-Day Baseline Demand  
Exploratory analysis reveals that passenger arrivals follow a highly repeatable daily 
pattern. To capture this regularity, we define a time-of-day baseline demand . 
Let 𝜏(𝑡)denote the position of interval 𝑡within a day (e.g., the index of a 5 -minute 
interval from midnight). For each regime 𝑤∈{0,1}, we define:  

𝜇𝑤(𝜏)=𝔼[𝑦𝑡∣𝑤𝑡=𝑤, 𝜏(𝑡)=𝜏]. 
 
This baseline represents the typical number of hall calls expected at a given time of day 
under weekday or weekend conditions. In practice, 𝜇𝑤(𝜏)is estimated using historical 
averages from the available data.  
4.1.4 Short -Term Adjustment Using Recent Observations  
While the baseline captures long -term regularity, actual demand may temporarily 
deviate from typical levels due to local fluctuations. To account for this effect, we 
introduce a deviation term:  
𝑒𝑡=𝑦𝑡−𝜇𝑤𝑡(𝜏(𝑡)). 
 
Empirical observations indicate that these deviations tend to persist over short time 
horizons. Therefore, we model the deviation using a first -order autoregressive structure:  
𝑒𝑡=𝜙𝑤𝑡 𝑒𝑡−1+𝜀𝑡, 
 
where ∣𝜙𝑤𝑡∣<1and 𝜀𝑡represents short -term random variability with zero mean.  
4.1.5 One -Step-Ahead Forecasting Formula  
Combining the baseline demand with the short -term adjustment yields the following 
prediction for the next interval:  
𝑦̂𝑡+1=𝜇𝑤𝑡+1(𝜏(𝑡+1))+𝜙𝑤𝑡[𝑦𝑡−𝜇𝑤𝑡(𝜏(𝑡))] 
 
This formulation reflects two intuitive components:  
• the expected demand at the next time of day , and  
• a correction term  based on whether recent demand has been higher or lower 
than usual.  
4.1.6 Parameter Estimation  
The baseline demand 𝜇𝑤(𝜏)is estimated by averaging historical hall -call counts for the 
corresponding regime and time -of-day interval.  
The autoregressive parameter 𝜙𝑤is estimated separately for weekdays and weekends 
using standard least -squares regression on the deviation series {𝑒𝑡}. This separation 

ensures that the model reflects the distinct temporal dynamics observed under different 
operating regimes.  
4.1.7 Interpretation and Model Applicability  
The proposed model captures both systematic daily patterns  and short-term 
demand persistence , enabling reliable prediction of near -future passenger flow. Its 
simplicity allows for efficient real -time computation, making it well suited for integration 
into elevator group control systems.  
The predicted value 𝑦̂𝑡+1serves as a key input for:  
• traffic mode identification (Task 2), and  
• proactive elevator parking decisions (Task 3).  
4.1.8 Limitations  
The model is designed to describe typical operating conditions and may not fully 
capture rare, unexpected events such as large unscheduled gatherings. Nevertheless, its 
transparency and robustness make it an appropriate foundation for short -term demand 
forecasting in this application.  
 
 
4.2 Model 2: Real -Time Traffic State Classification (Task 2)  
4.2.1 Objective of the Model  
Elevator traffic within a high -rise building is not uniform throughout the day. Instead, it 
evolves through a small number of recurring operational modes, such as morning up -
peak, lunchtime transitions, and evening down -peak.  
Identifying the current traffic state in real time is essential, since different elevator 
control and parking strategies are appropriate for different modes.  
The objective of Task 2 is therefore to develop a real-time classification model  that 
automatically assigns the building to a traffic state based on observable elevator call 
characteristics. The resulting state label serves as a decision signal for the dynamic 
parking strategy developed in Task 3.  
4.2.2 Definition of Traffic States  
Based on exploratory data analysis and common elevator traffic theory, we define the 
following set of discrete traffic states:  

𝒮
={Night Idle ,Morning Up -Peak,Lunch Down -Peak,Afternoon Mixed ,Evening Down -Peak,Weekend Low -Demand}. 
 
Each state corresponds to a distinct pattern of passenger behavior and directional flow, 
and therefore requires different operational responses.  
4.2.3 Real -Time Feature Construction  
To classify the current traffic state, we extract a set of features from the most recent 5 -
minute observation window, consistent with the forecasting horizon in Task 1.  
Let the following quantities be defined for time interval 𝑡: 
• 𝐶𝑡: total number of hall calls,  
• 𝐶𝑡𝑢𝑝: number of upward hall calls,  
• 𝐶𝑡𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛: number of downward hall calls,  
• 𝑟𝑡=𝐶𝑡𝑢𝑝
𝐶𝑡: proportion of upward calls,  
• 𝑝1,𝑡: proportion of hall calls originating from Floor 1,  
• 𝐻𝑡: spatial entropy of call distribution across floors, measuring how 
concentrated or dispersed the demand is.  
These features are combined into a feature vector:  
𝐱𝑡=(𝐶𝑡, 𝑟𝑡, 𝑝1,𝑡, 𝐻𝑡). 
 
All quantities are directly observable in real time and require no historical model 
training.  
4.2.4 Rule -Based State Classification Model  
Rather than relying on data -driven black -box classifiers, we adopt a rule-based 
classification approach . This ensures transparency, interpretability, and robustness, all 
of which are desirable in operational elevator control systems.  
The traffic state at time 𝑡, denoted 𝑠𝑡, is determined by the following decision rules:  

𝑠𝑡=
{    Night Idle , 𝐶𝑡<𝜃1,
Morning Up -Peak,𝐶𝑡≥𝜃2, 𝑟𝑡≥𝛼1, 𝑝1,𝑡≥𝛽1,
Evening Down -Peak, 𝐶𝑡≥𝜃3, 𝑟𝑡≤𝛼2,
Lunch Down -Peak,𝐶𝑡≥𝜃2, 𝛼2<𝑟𝑡<𝛼3,
Weekend Low -Demand, 𝑤𝑡=0,
Afternoon Mixed , otherwise . 
 
Here:  
• 𝜃1,𝜃2,𝜃3are demand intensity thresholds,  
• 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3define directional dominance,  
• 𝛽1captures the concentration of lobby -originated traffic.  
Threshold values are determined empirically using historical quantiles of the 
corresponding features, ensuring adaptability to different building scales and usage 
levels.  
4.2.5 Interpretation of Classification Logic  
Each classification rule reflects an intuitive interpretation of observed traffic behavior:  
• Night Idle  corresponds to minimal system activity, typically during late -night 
hours.  
• Morning Up -Peak is characterized by high demand, strong upward 
directionality, and heavy concentration at the lobby.  
• Lunch Down -Peak reflects a temporary downward migration of occupants, 
often involving multiple floors.  
• Evening Down -Peak exhibits the strongest downward dominance as occupants 
exit the building.  
• Afternoon Mixed  represents intermediate periods with balanced inter -floor 
movement.  
• Weekend Low -Demand  captures the fundamentally different usage patterns 
observed on weekends.  
This structure allows the system to respond not only to demand magnitude, but also to 
demand direction and spatial distribution.  
4.2.6 Role in the Integrated Framework  
The output of Model 2 is a discrete traffic state label 𝑠𝑡∈𝒮, updated every 5 minutes.  

This label is used in Task 3 to select appropriate elevator parking and repositioning 
strategies, enabling a state -aware and demand -responsive control policy.  
4.2.7 Advantages and Limitations  
Advantages  
• Fully interpretable and transparent decision logic,  
• No training data or computational overhead required,  
• Easily adaptable to other buildings by recalibrating thresholds.  
Limitations  
• The rule-based structure may not capture rare or atypical traffic patterns,  
• Threshold selection depends on historical data quality.  
Despite these limitations, the model provides a reliable and operationally meaningful 
representation of real -time elevator traffic states.  
 
 
4.3 Model 3: Dynamic Elevator Parking Strategy (Task 3)  
4.3.1 Objective of the Parking Strategy  
When an elevator becomes idle, its parking location has a significant impact on future 
passenger waiting times and system efficiency. A poorly chosen parking strategy may 
lead to long response times, unnecessary empty travel, and uneven elevator utilizatio n. 
The objective of Task 3 is to develop a dynamic elevator parking strategy  that 
determines:  
1. where idle elevators should be parked,  
2. how many elevators should be positioned at key locations, and  
3. when repositioning should occur,  
based on predicted near -future demand (Task 1) and the current traffic state (Task 2).  
4.3.2 Decision Framework and Inputs  
The parking strategy operates in discrete 5 -minute decision intervals, consistent with 
the time scale used in Tasks 1 and 2.  

At time interval 𝑡, the decision framework takes the following inputs:  
• 𝑦̂𝑡+1: predicted total hall -call demand in the next 5 -minute interval (Task 1),  
• 𝑠𝑡∈𝒮: current traffic state identified by the classification model (Task 2),  
• {𝑓𝑘}: current floor locations of all idle elevators.  
The output of the model is a set of parking assignments for idle elevators.  
4.3.3 Candidate Parking Floors  
Rather than allowing elevators to park arbitrarily at any floor, we define a limited set of 
candidate parking floors  based on spatial demand patterns observed in the 
exploratory data analysis:  
ℒ={Lobby, Mid-Zone, Upper-Zone}. 
 
These zones represent:  
• Lobby: the primary origin point during up -peak periods,  
• Mid-Zone: floors with consistently high daytime activity,  
• Upper-Zone: floors associated with concentrated downward demand during 
evening periods.  
Restricting parking locations to a small number of zones simplifies decision -making and 
enhances operational robustness.  
4.3.4 Conceptual Objective Function  
The parking strategy is designed to optimize overall system performance. Conceptually, 
we consider the following multi -objective function:  
min⁡𝐽=𝛼⋅AWT+𝛽⋅𝑃(Wait>𝜏)+𝛾⋅Empty Travel , 
 
where:  
• AWT denotes average passenger waiting time,  
• 𝑃(Wait>𝜏)represents the proportion of long -wait incidents exceeding a 
threshold 𝜏, 
• Empty Travel  measures unnecessary elevator movement without passengers,  
• 𝛼,𝛽,𝛾are non-negative weighting parameters.  

This objective guides the structure of the parking rules but does not require explicit 
numerical optimization.  
4.3.5 State -Dependent Parking Policy  
We propose a state-dependent rule -based parking policy , where parking decisions 
are determined primarily by the identified traffic state 𝑠𝑡. 
(1) Night Idle State  
When 𝑠𝑡=Night Idle , overall demand is minimal.  
Policy: 
• Maintain a small number of elevators at the lobby,  
• Park remaining idle elevators at their most recent stop floors to minimize 
unnecessary movement.  
(2) Morning Up -Peak State  
During morning up -peak periods, most passenger requests originate from the lobby 
and travel upward.  
Policy: 
• Allocate the majority of idle elevators to the lobby,  
• Minimize repositioning to upper zones unless demand predictions indicate 
unusually high activity.  
(3) Lunch Down -Peak State  
Lunchtime traffic involves significant downward movement from multiple occupied 
floors.  
Policy: 
• Distribute idle elevators across the mid -zone,  
• Reduce reliance on lobby parking to avoid delayed responses to upper -floor 
calls. 
(4) Afternoon Mixed State  
In the afternoon, traffic is characterized by balanced inter -floor movement.  
Policy: 
• Evenly distribute idle elevators among lobby, mid -zone, and upper -zone,  

• Aim to minimize the maximum distance between any idle elevator and potential 
call locations.  
(5) Evening Down -Peak State  
Evening traffic exhibits strong downward dominance, often originating from upper 
floors.  
Policy: 
• Pre-position a larger share of idle elevators in the upper -zone,  
• Maintain limited lobby presence to handle residual arrivals.  
(6) Weekend Low -Demand State  
Weekend traffic is sparse and less structured.  
Policy: 
• Keep a minimal number of elevators active at the lobby,  
• Park remaining elevators at nearby floors and prioritize energy -saving behavior.  
4.3.6 Role of Demand Prediction in Repositioning Timing  
The predicted demand 𝑦̂𝑡+1is used as a trigger for proactive repositioning.  
If 𝑦̂𝑡+1exceeds a predefined demand threshold, idle elevators may be repositioned 
before new calls are registered. This anticipatory behavior reduces response delays 
during emerging peak periods and prevents reactive congestion.  
4.3.7 Discussion of Strategy Characteristics  
The proposed parking strategy exhibits several desirable properties:  
• Interpretability : all decisions are based on transparent rules linked to 
observable traffic states,  
• Adaptability : the strategy automatically adjusts as the traffic state changes 
throughout the day,  
• Efficiency : unnecessary elevator movement is avoided during low -demand 
periods,  
• Practicality : the policy can be implemented as a software -level enhancement to 
existing group control systems.  
4.3.8 Limitations  

The strategy is designed for typical daily operating patterns and may not fully address 
rare, unexpected events. In such cases, manual overrides or adaptive threshold 
adjustments may be required. Nevertheless, for routine operations, the proposed policy 
provides a robust and effective approach to elevator parking management.  
 
 
Summary Sheet  
Problem B: The Elevator Pitch  
Background and Problem Statement  
In modern high -rise buildings, elevator efficiency strongly affects passenger experience, 
energy consumption, and system wear. A critical but often overlooked component of 
elevator group control is the parking strategy —deciding where idle elevators should 
wait for future calls. Static strategies, such as leaving elevators at their last stop or 
sending all idle cars to the lobby, fail to adapt to time -varying traffic patterns and may 
result in long waiting times and unne cessary empty travel.  
Using 30 days of operational data from a bank of eight elevators in a mixed -use 
building, this study develops a set of mathematical models to support predictive, 
state-aware, and dynamic elevator parking decisions . 
Task 1: Short -Term Passenger Flow Prediction  
To anticipate near -future demand, we model the total number of hall calls in the next 
5-minute interval. Exploratory data analysis reveals strong time-of-day regularity , 
clear weekday –weekend differences , and short-term temporal dependence . 
We propose a regime -based time -series model that decomposes demand into:  
1. a time-of-day baseline , representing typical passenger behavior at each 
moment of the day, and  
2. a short-term adjustment , capturing recent deviations from typical levels.  
The resulting model predicts future demand using both historical daily patterns and 
recent observations. The forecasted passenger flow serves as an early indicator of 
emerging congestion and provides input for subsequent traffic classification and 
parking decisions.  
Task 2: Real -Time Traffic State Classification  
Elevator traffic does not evolve continuously but instead switches among a small 

number of recurring operational modes. Based on data analysis and elevator traffic 
theory, we define discrete traffic states including Morning Up -Peak, Lunch Down -
Peak, Afternoon Mixed , Evening Down -Peak, Night Idle , and Weekend Low -
Demand . 
A rule-based classification model is developed using real -time features such as:  
• total hall call volume,  
• proportion of upward calls,  
• concentration of lobby -originated requests, and  
• spatial distribution of calls across floors.  
Transparent decision rules map these features to traffic states without requiring model 
training. This approach ensures interpretability and enables reliable real -time 
identification of the building’s current operating mode.  
Task 3: Dynamic Elevator Parking Strategy  
Using the predicted demand (Task 1) and identified traffic state (Task 2), we design a 
state-dependent dynamic parking strategy  for idle elevators. Candidate parking 
locations are grouped into functional zones, including the lobby, mid -level floors, and 
upper-level floors.  
For each traffic state, tailored parking rules determine:  
• where idle elevators should be positioned,  
• how many elevators should be allocated to each zone, and  
• when proactive repositioning should occur.  
The strategy is guided by a conceptual objective that balances average waiting time, 
long-wait occurrences, and unnecessary empty travel. By pre -positioning elevators near 
expected demand sources, the proposed policy improves responsiveness during peak 
periods while conserving energy during low -demand intervals.  
Conclusions  
Together, the three models form an integrated framework that links prediction , 
classification , and decision-making. The proposed approach replaces static parking 
rules with a flexible, data -informed strategy that adapts to changing traffic conditions 
throughout the day. This framework enhances passenger experience, improves system 
efficiency, and provides a practical foundation for smarter elevator group control 
systems.  

Memo to Building Management and Elevator Maintenance Company  
Subject: Proposal for a Dynamic Elevator Parking Strategy Based on Building Traffic 
Patterns  
To: Building Management Team and Elevator Maintenance Company  
From: MCM Modeling Team  
Date: [Insert Date]  
Executive Summary  
This memo proposes a dynamic elevator parking strategy  designed to reduce 
passenger waiting times, decrease unnecessary elevator movement, and improve 
overall system efficiency.  
Unlike traditional static approaches —such as leaving elevators at their last stop or 
returning all idle elevators to the lobby —our strategy adapts in real time to changing 
traffic conditions within the building.  
Using historical operational data and observed traffic patterns, we recommend a state -
aware parking policy that positions idle elevators closer to where future demand is most 
likely to occur.  
Why Current Parking Strategies Are Inefficient  
Conventional parking strategies are simple but inflexible:  
• Leaving elevators at their last stop  often places idle cars far from the next 
passenger request.  
• Sending all idle elevators to the lobby  increases empty travel, energy 
consumption, and congestion during non –up-peak periods.  
Our analysis shows that elevator demand varies significantly throughout the day. Traffic 
patterns during morning arrivals, lunchtime movement, afternoon activity, and evening 
departures are fundamentally different. A single static parking rule cannot perfo rm well 
across all these scenarios.  
Overview of the Proposed Strategy  
The proposed approach integrates three key components:  
1. Short-term demand anticipation  
Near-future passenger demand is estimated using recent activity and time -of-
day patterns.  
2. Traffic state identification  

The building’s current operating mode (e.g., morning up -peak, evening down -
peak, low -demand periods) is identified using simple, transparent rules based 
on real-time data.  
3. State-dependent parking decisions  
When an elevator becomes idle, its parking location is determined by the 
current traffic state rather than a fixed default rule.  
This allows the system to respond proactively rather than reactively.  
How the Strategy Works in Practice  
• Morning Up -Peak:  
Most idle elevators are positioned at the lobby to quickly serve incoming 
passengers.  
• Lunchtime and Afternoon Periods:  
Elevators are distributed across mid -level floors where inter -floor movement is 
most common.  
• Evening Down -Peak:  
More elevators are pre -positioned at upper floors to reduce response time for 
departing occupants.  
• Nighttime and Weekends:  
Only a minimal number of elevators remain active at the lobby, while others 
remain parked to minimize energy use and wear.  
This adaptive behavior ensures that elevators are closer to anticipated demand, 
reducing response delays.  
Expected Benefits  
Implementing this dynamic parking strategy is expected to deliver several benefits:  
• Reduced passenger waiting times , particularly during peak periods.  
• Fewer long -wait incidents , improving occupant satisfaction.  
• Lower energy consumption , by minimizing unnecessary empty travel.  
• More balanced elevator usage , reducing uneven wear and maintenance 
burden.  
Importantly, the strategy relies on rule -based logic and does not require complex 
optimization algorithms, making it practical to integrate into existing group control 
systems.  

Implementation Considerations  
• The strategy can be implemented as a software -level enhancement  without 
changes to elevator hardware.  
• Decision rules and thresholds can be adjusted to reflect building -specific 
characteristics.  
• The approach is transparent and interpretable, allowing operators to understand 
and fine-tune system behavior.  
Conclusion  
By replacing static parking rules with a dynamic, traffic -aware strategy, the building can 
significantly improve elevator performance and operational efficiency.  
The proposed solution aligns with real -world usage patterns, is easy to implement, and 
provides a scalable foundation for smarter elevator management.  
We recommend pilot testing this strategy during selected operating hours to evaluate 
its performance and refine parameters before full deployment.
